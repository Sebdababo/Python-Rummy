This is a my first python project

A very simplified version of a Rummy Game played without jokers and wild cards.

Gameplay:
  
  1. Draw: Player draws from either the pile or the discard pile
  
  2. Meld: Player can place sets or sequences
  
      1. Sets: 3 or 4 card of the same rank
      2. Sequences: 3 or more consecutive cardd of the same suit
  
  3. Lay off: Player can add cards to his or other player’s existing melds
  
  4. Winning the Game
  
      1. A player „goes out“
